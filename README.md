# Terraform Deployment Steps

- **`1) Build Infrastructure`**: This step creates AWS resources using Terraform's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configuration files.
  <details>
  <summary><strong>Show Build Infrastructure</strong></summary>

  ![Apply Demo](documentation/gifs/terraform_apply.gif)

  </details>
  
  **Note**: Some modules may take longer to create and few will fail:
   - module.certificates.aws_acm_certificate_validation.szumi_dev_cert_validation
   - module.certificates.aws_acm_certificate_validation.szumi_dev_cert_validation_us_east_1`
   - Issue when creating Lambda Function (`dev_media_convert_trigger`): "operation error Lambda: CreateFunction: Provide a valid source image."
   
   To fix issues above:

- **`2) Change Domain Server Names`**: Update the DNS settings at Domain Provider to point to AWS Route 53, facilitating the resolution of the `aws_acm_certificate_validation` challenge.
  <details>
  <summary><strong>Show Change Domain Server Names</strong></summary>

  ![Images Deployed](documentation/gifs/images_deployed.gif)

  </details>

- **`4) Apply Terraform Once Again`**: After DNS updates and certificate validations, reapply Terraform. If errors persist, allow some time for settings to propagate before retrying.

# CI/CD GitHub Configuration

To enable automatic updates of the ECS service and tasks via the CI/CD pipeline upon a Git push, you need to configure several secrets within GitHub. These secrets facilitate GitHub Actions to update AWS ECS and Lambda for continuous deployment.

## Setting Up AWS User

Before populating GitHub secrets, create an AWS user with the necessary permissions to provision all the required resources. This userâ€™s credentials will be used to authenticate and authorize operations initiated by GitHub Actions.

1. **Create an AWS IAM user** with programmatic access. This will generate an `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
2. **Attach policies** that grant the user sufficient permissions to manage ECS, Lambda, and other AWS services involved in your deployment.

## Populating GitHub Secrets

Once the AWS user is set up, you'll need to add these credentials to your GitHub repository as secrets:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The access key ID from your AWS IAM user.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The secret access key corresponding to the above ID.

  </details>

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Show Create User Keys</strong></summary>

  ![User Keys Demo](documentation/gifs/aws_tf_keys.gif)

  </details>


***Please note*** that I have opted to grant the 'AdministratorAccess' policy to our Terraform user as a temporary shortcut. Ideally, access should be restricted and limited to only those resources necessary for provisioning the infrastructure.

Additionally, retrieve other necessary secrets from the Terraform outputs:

- Navigate to the root of your Terraform project.
- Run `terraform output` to fetch most of the variables needed.
- If some variables are missing, add them to `outputs.tf` to ensure they are outputted by Terraform.

```bash
terraform output
```

**Current Support in CI/CD**:

**`Important`**: Currently, the CI/CD pipeline only supports the Lambda converter and the core ECS backend. The frontend and Terraform infrastructure are not integrated into the CI/CD process and must be deployed manually.

# Next Steps
- **`1) Deploy static frontend`**: The script updates an AWS S3 bucket with static files from a local directory, specifically configured for hosting a Next.js website. First we run `npm run` build then `update-front` makefile command.

# NOTE

Currently, the PostgreSQL database is exposed to the internet, configured for debugging purposes to allow direct connections without a jump host. For production environments, it is advisable to remove this exposure to mitigate security risks.

```terraform
  ingress {
    from_port   = 5432
    to_port     = 5432
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
```
